# Graph implementations

This repository contains implementations of the graph data structure and algorithms on it, which I implemented using Java. Currently implemented algorithms include:

- Storing graph in memory using adjacency matrix, adjacency list and incidence matrix
- Calculation of distance matrix for graph vertices
- Breadth-first search and bfs which returns a tree
- Dijkstra's algorithm
